			<p>This February, a DC regional Volcanology Workshop will be hosted at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center to reprise 2013 and last yearâ€™s successful workshops. This all-day workshop will bring together the volcanologists at our neighboring institutions for a rewarding day of presentations and discussions focused on developing new collaborations and research paths in the future.</p>
			<p>The date of the workshop has been set as Friday, February 16th, 2018. Attendance to the workshop is absolutely free, though we plan to have lunch catered for a nominal fee of ~$10, similar to last year. To allow time for NASA GSFC to prepare visitor badges for all attendees, the Registration Deadline will be January 1, 2018.</p>
			<p>We encourage all geoscientists interested in volcanology and related processes to register for this workshop and present your research to the community. We also encourage labs and institutions to give a talk that outlines the interesting work/personnel that their institution hosts. This workshop is intended to be highly interactive and will include science talks and periods for discussion on relevant topics.</p>
