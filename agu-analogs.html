			<h3>Welcome! This is the Gathering Space for the Planetary Analogs Sessions of AGU.</h3>
			<p>Is this your first time in a Gather Town Space? It is sort of like a Zoom call where you interact with folks nearby your character. You can walk around this area with your arrow keys. When you are close to people, you will be able to interact with them like a Zoom call. There is also a chat function that you can open in the bottom left. If you have questions, feel free to find Jacob Richardson in the room and ask him. Below are some maps of how this room works:</p>
			<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="images/agu_gather/Basemap.png" style="width:60%;"/></p>
			<p>Each e-Lightning presentation has its own space in this room. When you are in a poster space (noted by the carpet), you can hear only people at the same poster space. The real AGU poster is not linked to in this room, but you can have the poster open in another tab or the presenter can share their screen near their own poster! To share a screen, press the Monitor icon at the bottom of the screen.</p>
			<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="images/agu_gather/PosterSpaceMap.png" style="width:40%;"/></p>
			<p>When you are in the public areas, you can hear and speak to anyone near you! Here are a few more tips: You can't walk through most tables, walls, or people. If you get stuck when you are surrounded by people, hold the 'g' key as you move and you will become a ghost for a second.</p>
